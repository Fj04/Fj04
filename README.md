- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Fj
- last month I invest 1000$ on a website called Bitcoptions.com
- they promise me That after a month It will earn a 100% profit
- after that Yes It says on the website I earned another 1000$
- but when I tried to withdraw my investment of 1000$ it won't work
- so I contacted them but they won't respond and then I can't contact them anymore. ðŸ˜¢
- the worst is after that I am suffering now on depression
- Because I can't forgive myself because I trusted them
- I'm always talk to myself "why me? That money is all I have, I'm just a poor person. Why me?
- It's stuck to my head. All I want is to have back my money thats all. 
- If anyone can see it please help me just a little
- I just need my money back
- can you donate me some? Thank you ðŸ˜¢
- here's my ETH(ERC20) wallet address Thank you for your time. Godbless always
